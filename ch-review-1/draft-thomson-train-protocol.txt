  Transparent Rate Adaptation Indicators for Network Elements (TRAIN)
                  draft-thomson-train-protocol-latest

Abstract

   On-path network elements can sometimes be configured to apply rate
   limits to flows that pass them.  This document describes a method for
   signaling to endpoints that rate limiting policies are in force and
   approximately what that rate limit is.

1.  Introduction

   Many access networks limit the maximum data rate that attached
   devices are able to attain.  This is often done without any
   indication to the applications running on devices.  The result can be
   that application performance is degraded, as the manner in which rate
   limits are enforced can be incompatible with the rate estimation or
   congestion control algorithms used at endpoints.

   Having the network indicate what its rate limiting policy is, in a
   way that is accessible to endpoints, might allow applications to use
   this inforation when adapting their send rate.

2.  Overview

   Network elements that have rate limiting policies can use this
   protocol on any QUIC flow containing long header packets.  The
   network element indicates an approximate rate limit by replacing the
   version field of the QUIC packet.

   A number of QUIC versions are reserved for each canonical QUIC
   version.  Each version indicates a specific rate limit.

   +--------+    +---------+    +----------+
   |  QUIC  |    | Network |    |   QUIC   |
   | Sender |    | Element |    | Receiver |
   +---+----+    +----+----+    +----+-----+
       |              |              |
       +---- v1 ----->|              |
       |              +----- vx ---->|
       |              |              |  vx ==> rate limit = y
       |              |              |     ==> v1
       |              |              |

   QUIC endpoints that support this protocol and receive a long header
   packet with one of these QUIC versions first recover the intended
   rate limit by mapping the version number to a specific rate.  The
   packet is then processed as normal by replacing the rate limit
   indication with the original or canonical version.

   Indicated rate limits apply only in a single direction.  Separate
   indications can be sent for the client-to-server direction and
   server-to-client direction.  The indicated rates do not need to be
   the same.

   Indicated rate limits only apply to the path on which they are
   received.  A connection that migrates or uses multipath [QUIC-MP]
   cannot assume that rate limit indications from one path apply to new
   paths.

3.  Applicability

   This protocol only works for flows that use specific QUIC versions
   and only where those flows include packets using the long header
   Section 5.1 of [RFC8999].

   The information provided to endpoints (or applications at those
   endpoints) is advisory.  The protocol requires that packets are
   modified as they transit a network element, which provides endpoints
   proof that the network element has the power to drop packets.
   However, it does not prove that the rate limit that is indicated
   would either be successful; nor does it prove that a higher rate
   would not be successful.  Endpoints that receive this signal
   therefore need to treat the information as advisory.

   As an advisory signal, network elements cannot assume that endpoints
   will respect the signal.  Though this might reduce the need for more
   active rate limiting, whether rate limit enforcement is necessary is
   a matter for network policy.

   The time and scope over which a rate limit applies is not specified.
   Rate limits might change without being signaled.  The signaled limit
   can be assumed to apply to the flow of packets on the same UDP
   address tuple for the duration of that flow.  Rate limiting policies
   often apply on the level of a device or subscription, but endpoints
   cannot assume that this is the case.  A separate signal can be sent
   for each flow.

   The same UDP address tuple might be used for multiple QUIC
   connections.  A single signal might be lost or only reach a single
   application endpoint.  Network elements that signal about a flow
   might choose to send additional signals, using connection IDs to
   indicate when new connections could be involved.

   The endpoint that receives a rate limit signal is not the endpoint
   that might adapt its sending behavior as a result of receiving the
   signal.  An endpoint might need to communicate the value it receives
   to its peer in order to ensure that the limit is respected.  This
   document does not define how that signaling occurs as this is
   specific to the application in use.

   shown here.

5.  Version Mappings

   This document defines version number mappings for QUIC version 1
   [RFC9000] and version 2 [RFC9369].  Rate limit mappings are defined
   for a limited number of send rates, as shown in Table 1.

      |  Note: The exact set of rates that are included is subject to
      |  negotiation.

                  |      3Mbps | 0xTBD     | 0xTBD     |

                  |      4Mbps | 0xTBD     | 0xTBD     |

                  |     20Mbps | 0xTBD     | 0xTBD     |
                  +------------+-----------+-----------+
                  |     50Mbps | 0xTBD     | 0xTBD     |
                  +------------+-----------+-----------+

                     Table 1: Version and Rate Limit
                                 Mappings

   Packets for each of these versions is processed exactly as they would
   be for QUIC version 1 or QUIC version 2.  In particular, when a
   packet with one of these versions is received, the value of the
   version field is replaced by the version number for either QUIC
   version 1 (0x00000001) or QUIC version 2 (0x6b3343cf).  Thus, the
   packet protection mechanism used by the canonical QUIC version is
   identical and AEAD decryption would fail if the limit-specific
   version number is left in place.

   For example, the example Retry packet from Appendix A.4 of [RFC9369]
   might be modified to indicate a rate limit of TBD to produce a packet
   of:

   cfXXXXXXXX0008f067a5502a4262b574 6f6b656ec8646ce8bfe33952d9555436
   65dcc7b6

   But the 4 bytes of the version number will be restored to 0x6b3343cf
   before attempting to process the packet further.

   The "trigger" version used by the endpoints when sending long header
   packets that on-path network elements are authorized to rewrite.
   receiving packets with that value indicates that no on-path element
   provided a bandwidth indication.

      |  TODO: we should indicate that the bandwidth here is the maximum
      |  receive rate.  That is, if A sends a long header packet and B
      |  receives that packet with a version encoding the bandwidth,
      |  that version indicates the maximum rate at which B can send and
      |  A can receive.  That way we don't need B to echo a max send
      |  rate value to A.

6.  Onboarding the train

   The TRAIN extension requires cooperation between the two endpoints.
   Each endpoint indicates its willingness to receive long header
   packets by publishing the "train-station-ready" transport parameter
   (TBD), which a zero length value.

   Endpoint MAY set the version field of long header packets to the
   trigger value if the peer has published the "train-station-ready"
   parameter.

7.  Deployment

   Rate limiting signals that are applied in this way do not guarantee
   that the signal is successfully received.

   The primary cost associated with the application of rate limit
   signals is the potential for the packet to be dropped as a
   consequence of the changed version.  An endpoint that does not
   recognize these new versions will treat the modification as damage
   and discard the packet.

      |  TODO: do we need to define a new QUIC version where support for
      |  that version also indicates support for this feature?  That
      |  might allow endpoints to know that their long header packets,
      |  if modified, won't get dropped.  YES: see "trigger" above.

      |  TODO: determine whether we want a frame that solicits the
      |  sending of a long header packet.

7.1.  Changing Rate Limit Signals

   A network element might receive a packet that already includes a rate
   limit signal.  If the network element wishes to signal a lower rate
   limit, they can replace the Version field with a different value that
   indicates the lower limit.  If the network element wishes to signal a
   higher rate limit, they leave the signal alone, preserving the signal
   from the network element that has a lower rate limit policy.

7.2.  Providing Opportunities to Attach Rate Limit Signals

   A UDP that contains QUIC packets does not always use the long header.
   For example, a connection can migrate to a new path without using
   anything other than a short header on that new path.  Endpoints that
   wish to offer network elements the option to add rate limit markings
   can send long header packets

   Long header packets might indicate the use of packet protection keys
   that are long discarded by an endpoint.  Endpoints that receive long
   header packets can process rate limit signals before attempting to
   remove packet protection or before discarding these packets.

   An endpoint that send long header packets for this purpose SHOULD
   send those packets as the first packet of a datagram, including
   additional valid packets.  An endpoint that receives and discards a
   packet when there are no valid packets in the datagram SHOULD ignore
   any rate limit signal.  Such a datagram might be entirely spoofed.

8.  Security Considerations

   The modification of packets provides endpoints proof that a network
   element is in a position to drop datagrams and thereby enforce the
   indicated rate limit.  Section 7.2 suggests that endpoints only
   accept signals if the datagram contains a packet that it accepts to
   prevent an off-path attacker from inserting spurious rate limit
   signals.

   The actual value of the rate limit signal is not authenticated.  Any
   signal might be incorrectly set in order to encourage endpoints to
   behave in ways that are not in their interests.  Endpoints are free
   to ignore limits that they think are incorrect.

   Similarly, if there is a strong need to ensure that a rate limit is
   respected, network elements cannot assume that the signaled limit
   will be respected by endpoints.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers many new QUIC versions.

      |  TODO: actually pick some numbers and register them.
