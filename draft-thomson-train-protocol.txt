  Transparent Rate Adaptation Indicators for Network Elements (TRAIN)
                  draft-thomson-train-protocol-latest

Abstract

   On-path network elements can sometimes be configured to apply rate
   limits to flows that pass them.  This document describes a method for
   signaling to endpoints that rate limiting policies are in force and
   approximately what that rate limit is.

1.  Introduction

   Many access networks limit the maximum data rate that attached
   devices are able to attain.  This is often done without any
   indication to the applications running on devices.  The result can be
   that application performance is degraded, as the manner in which rate
   limits are enforced can be incompatible with the rate estimation or
   congestion control algorithms used at endpoints.

   Having the network indicate what its rate limiting policy is, in a
   way that is accessible to endpoints, might allow applications to use
   this inforation when adapting their send rate.

2.  Overview

   Network elements that have rate limiting policies can use this
   protocol on any QUIC flow containing long header packets.  The
   network element indicates an approximate rate limit by replacing the
   version field of the QUIC packet.

   A number of QUIC versions are reserved for each canonical QUIC
   version.  Each version indicates a specific rate limit.

   +--------+    +---------+    +----------+
   |  QUIC  |    | Network |    |   QUIC   |
   | Sender |    | Element |    | Receiver |
   +---+----+    +----+----+    +----------+
       |              |              |
       +---- v1 ----->|              |
       |              +----- vx ---->|
       |              |              |  vx ==> rate limit = y
       |              |              |     ==> v1
       |              |              |

   QUIC endpoints that support this protocol and receive a long header
   packet with one of these QUIC versions first recover the intended
   rate limit by mapping the version number to a specific rate.  The
   packet is then processed as normal by replacing the rate limit
   indication with the original or canonical version.

   Indicated rate limits apply only in a single direction.  Separate
   indications can be sent for the client-to-server direction and
   server-to-client direction.  The indicated rates do not need to be
   the same.

   Indicated rate limits only apply to the path on which they are
   received.  A connection that migrates or uses multipath [QUIC-MP]
   cannot assume that rate limit indications from one path apply to new
   paths.

3.  Applicability

   This protocol only works for flows that use specific QUIC versions
   and only where those flows include packets using the long header
   Section 5.1 of [RFC8999].

   The information provided to endpoints (or applications at those
   endpoints) is advisory.  The protocol requires that packets are
   modified as they transit a network element, which provides endpoints
   proof that the network element has the power to drop packets.
   However, it does not prove that the rate limit that is indicated
   would either be successful; nor does it prove that a higher rate
   would not be successful.  Endpoints that receive this signal
   therefore need to treat the information as advisory.

   As an advisory signal, network elements cannot assume that endpoints
   will respect the signal.  Though this might reduce the need for more
   active rate limiting, whether rate limit enforcement is necessary is
   a matter for network policy.

4.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [BCP14] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
   shown here.

5.  Version Mappings

   This document defines version number mappings for QUIC version 1
   [RFC9000] and version 2 [RFC9369].  Rate limit mappings are defined
   for a limited number of send rates, as shown in Table 1.

      |  Note: The exact set of rates that are included is subject to
      |  negotiation.
